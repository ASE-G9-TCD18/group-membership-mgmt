# Group Membership Management for Distributed Systems

A group membership management service that provides the (remaining) members of 
a group with a consistent view of its membership at any time and that tolerates 
the full range of failures that commonly arise in distributed systems, e.g., 
node or process failure, loss messages, and/or network partitions etc, etc.
